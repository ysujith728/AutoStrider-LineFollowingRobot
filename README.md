## 🌐 Simulation Link
🔗 **Try it yourself:**  
[AutoStrider — Tinkercad Simulation](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/lGTo1RcW4o6-auto-strider?sharecode=RSIFxj7kJPw8u6VMCZKzwJHGUvhD_voBYZLE4GNoEdc)

## 🧩 Overview
**AutoStrider** is an intelligent line-following robot capable of autonomously following a black track using IR sensors.  
It’s powered by an Arduino UNO and uses an H-bridge motor driver for directional control.

The project was implemented **both in simulation (Tinkercad)** and as a **physical prototype**, validating real-world performance.

## ⚙️ Features
- Dual IR sensor module for line detection  
- Directional control using L293D driver  
- PWM-based speed control for balanced movement  
- Smooth line tracking logic (forward, left, right, stop)  
- Simulation & real hardware prototype  

---

## 🧠 Working Principle
- Two IR sensors continuously scan the surface below.
- Black line reflects less IR light → sensor outputs `LOW`.
- Depending on sensor output:
  - Both LOW → move forward  
  - Left LOW, Right HIGH → turn right  
  - Right LOW, Left HIGH → turn left  
  - Both HIGH → stop

## 🔌 Circuit Connection

| Arduino Pin | Connection | Description |
|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| D11 | IR Sensor (Right) | Line detection |
| D12 | IR Sensor (Left) | Line detection |
| D6 | Enable Right Motor | PWM speed control |
| D7, D8 | Right Motor Direction | |
| D5 | Enable Left Motor | PWM speed control |
| D9, D10 | Left Motor Direction | |

🧭 Common Ground must be shared between Arduino and motor driver power.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open `Autostrider.ino` in Arduino IDE  
2. Connect Arduino UNO via USB  
3. Select the correct board & COM port  
4. Upload the code  
5. Open **Serial Monitor** (9600 baud) to observe sensor readings  
6. Place robot on black line track and watch it follow autonomously!  

---

## 🔧 Calibration Tips
- Adjust `MOTOR_SPEED_LEFT` and `MOTOR_SPEED_RIGHT` for balanced speed.  
- Keep sensors 0.5–1cm above the track.  
- Use matte black electrical tape for better contrast.  

---

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
- Add **PID control** for smoother turns  
- Integrate **Bluetooth module** for manual control  
- Add **ultrasonic sensor** for obstacle avoidance  
- Implement **battery voltage monitoring**
